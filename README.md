- 👋 Hi, I’m @shanice-mckay! I'm a 1st year computer science student at the University of Technology, Jamaica.
- 👀 I’m interested in pursuing further education in Human Computer Interaction, but as for right now, the intersectionality of tech and the environment and mental health pique my interest.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and Python and my favourite class so far has been Computer Networks [CMP1026].
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of all sorts to find my place in this industry!
- 📫 You can reach me via email at shanice.mckay@outlook.com
